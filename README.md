## Commit history
This is a copy of an internal pipeline that I built for a client that I've reproduced in my own GitHub with permission, as a portfolio piece to show the pipelines that I build.
I reset the commit history so the client isn't identifiable from the email addresses.

## Overview

This is a [Singer](https://singer.io) tap that produces JSON-formatted
data from the [Simpro](https://www.simprogroup.com/) API following the [Singer
spec](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started/blob/master/SPEC.md).

This tap:

- Pulls raw data from the [Simpro API](https://developer.simprogroup.com/apidoc/)
- Extracts the following resources from Simpro:
  - Jobs
  - Sites
  - Customers
  - Contacts
  - Employees
  - Schedules
- Outputs the schema for each resource
- Incrementally pulls data based on the input state

## Quick start

1. Install

   We recommend using a virtualenv:

   ```bash
   > virtualenv -p python3 venv
   > source venv/bin/activate
   > pip install -e .
   ```

2. Create the config file

   Create a JSON file called `config.json` containing your access token and the ID for the company that you want to sync data for.

   ```json
   {
     "access_token": "your_access_token",
     "company_id": "0",
     "base_url": "https://yourcompany.simprosuite.com"
   }
   ```

3. Run the tap in discovery mode to get properties.json file

   ```bash
   tap-simpro --config config.json --discover > properties.json
   ```

4. In the properties.json file, select the streams to sync

   Each stream in the properties.json file has a "schema" entry. To select a stream to sync, add `"selected": true` to that stream's "schema" entry. For example, to sync the pull_requests stream:

   ```
   ...
   "tap_stream_id": "jobs",
   "schema": {
     "selected": true,
     "properties": {
   ...
   ```

5. Run the application

   `tap-simpro` can be run with:

   ```bash
   tap-simpro --config config.json --properties properties.json
   ```
